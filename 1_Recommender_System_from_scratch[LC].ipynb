More formally, recommender systems adopt data-mining and machine-learning techniques to help users in finding attractive and useful products. Products can be almost anything: physical items (e.g., smartphones), places (e.g., restaurants), digital content (e.g., movies and music), and many more. Recommender systems produce recommendations based on different inputs: demographic information about users, ratings and comments on products, individual’s or community’s past preferences and choices, social networks, context of use.\n","\n","There are many different types of techniques and implementations out there.\n","\n","- **Content-based methods** uses attributes of items to recommend to users new items similar to what the user has liked in the past (doesn't take into account the behaviour of other users);\n","- **Collaborative Filtering methods** uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to determine recommendations;\n","- **Hybrid methos** mix content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.\n","\n","Other approaches are also called **Knowlege-based methods** which uses explicit knowledge about users and items to build recommendations criteria with a rule-based approach.\n","\n","\n","<center>  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Qaizz9YLvqgXg0blWFwN92IQSQPLTSoH\" width=\"950\" height=\"400\"> </center>\n","\n","\n","In the following we'll focus on Collaborative Filtering methods, with a model-based approach with deep learning algorithms.\n","\n","### Problem Definition\n","\n","Given a past record of movies seen by a user, we will build a recommender system that helps the user discover movies of their interest.\n","\n","Specifically, given <userID, itemID> occurrence pairs, we need to generate a ranked list of movies for each user.\n","\n","We model the problem as a binary classification problem, where we learn a function to predict whether a particular user will like a particular movie or not.\n","\n","$$f(userid, itemid) →, [0,1]$$\n","\n","The model takes in two sparse vectors, one representing the user and the other represents items.

These embeddings can be seen as a latent vector for users and items.\n","\n","Thus, the final predictive model will be\n","$$y_{ui} = f(\\mathbf{P}^T\\mathbf{v}_u^T, \\mathbf{Q}^T\\mathbf{v}_i^T | \\mathbf{P}, \\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{\\Theta}_f) $$\n","\n","where **P** and **Q** denotes the latent factor matrix for users and items and **$\\Theta_f$** denotes the model parameters.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vwK9BJ1bss0_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Packages"],"metadata":{"id":"9131NU_plgbG"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"id":"Yji9-7jslKRz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714902029289,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2325,"user":{"displayName":"Diego Corna","userId":"08273269119675169107"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import time\n","import random\n","import argparse\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import torch.utils.data as data\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["np.random.seed(7)\n","torch.manual_seed(0)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"arJu3Re7XCky","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714902029289,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Diego Corna","userId":"08273269119675169107"}},"outputId":"4b8f5aac-089c-45ad-a5db-9896b3e17bde"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<torch._C.Generator at 0x7e7a91123210>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()\n","device = torch.device(\"cuda:0\" if use_cuda else \"cpu\")"],"metadata":{"id":"IkcVzJcY5TS_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714902029289,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Diego Corna","userId":"08273269119675169107"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Movielens Dataset\n","\n","### Dataset\n","\n","We use the MovieLens 100K dataset, which has 100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies.\n","\n","The ratings are given to us in form of <userID,itemID, rating, timestamp> tuples.

We truncate the ranked list at 10.\n","\n","Since it is too time-consuming to rank all items for every user, for we will have to calculate 1000\\*1700 ~10⁶ values. With this strategy, we need 1000*100 ~ 10⁵ values, an order of magnitude less.\n","\n","For each user, we use the latest rating(according to timestamp) in the test set, and we use the rest for training. This evaluation methodology is also known as leave-one-out strategy.\n","\n","#### Metrics\n","\n","We use **Hit Ratio** (HR), and **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain** (NDCG) to evaluate the performance for our RS.\n","\n","\n","In recommender settings, the **HR** is simply the fraction of users for which the correct answer is included in the recommendation list of length L.\n","\n","$$HR = \\frac{|U_{hit}^{L}|}{U_{all}}$$\n","\n","Where $U_{hit}^{L}$ is the number of users for which the correct answer is included in the top L recommendation list, while, $U_{all}$ is the total number of user in the test dataset. Clearly the larger L is the larger HR become.\n","\n","**NDCG** is a measure of ranking quality. In information retrieval, it is often used to measure effectiveness of web search engine algorithms or related applications. Using a graded relevance scale of documents in a search-engine result set, DCG measures the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The gain is accumulated from the top of the result list to the bottom, with the gain of each result discounted at lower ranks\n","\n","**Gain** for an item is essentialy the same as the relevance score, which can be numerical ratings like search results in Google which can be rated in scale from 1 to 5, or binary in case of implicit data where we only know if a user has consumed certain item or not. Naturally **Cumulative Gain** is defined as the sum of gains up to a position k in the recommendation list.\n","\n","$$CG(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}G_i$$\n","\n","One obvious drawback of CG is that it does not take into account of ordering. By swapping the relative order of any two items, the CG would be unaffected. This is problematic when ranking order is important. For example, on Google Search results, you would obviously not like placing the most relevant web page at the bottom.\n","\n","To penalize highly relevant items being placed at the bottom, we introduce the **Discounted Cumulative Gaing** (DCG).\n","\n","$$DCG(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{G_i}{log_2(i+1)}$$\n","\n","By diving the gain by its rank, we sort of push the algorithm to place highly relevant items to the top to achieve the best DCG score.\n","\n","There is still a drawback of DCG score. It is that DCG score adds up with the length of recommendation list. Therefore, we cannot consistently compare the DCG score for system recommending top 5 and top 10 items, because the latter will have higher score not because its recommendation quality but pure length.\n","\n","We tackle this issue by introducing **Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain** (IDCG). IDCG is the DCG score for the most ideal ranking, which is ranking the items top down according their relevance up to position k.\n","\n","$$IDCG(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{|I(k)|} \\frac{G_i}{log_2(i+1)}$$\n","\n","Where $|I(k)|$ represent the ideal list of items up to position k.\n","\n","And NDCG is simply to normalize the DCG score by IDCG such that its value is always between 0 and 1 regardless of the length.\n","\n","$$NDCD(k) = \\frac{DCG(k)}{IDCG(k)}$$\n","\n","Our model gives a confidence score between 0 and 1 for each item present in the test set for a given user. The items are sorted in decreasing order of their score, and top 10 items are given as recommendation. If the test item (which is only one for each user) is present in this list, HR is one for this user, else it is zero. The final HR is reported after averaging for all users. A similar calculation is done for NDCG.\n","\n","While training, we will be minimizing the cross-entropy loss, which is the standard loss function for a classification problem. The real strength of RS lies in giving a ranked list of top-k items, which a user is most likely to interact. Think about why you mostly click on google search results only on the first page, and never go to other pages.
